I made this for the Boba drop YSWS, and is my first time making a website. I tried to make something that was a little bit like a christmas card, and you can share the side, and I tried to add some extra features like some music (that does not really sound very christmasy). To run it you can visit the demo link. or you can just download the code and extract the code from the ZIP, and run the HTML code.
